# Test Failure Fixes Applied

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the test failures identified in the compute platform validation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Service Import Issues ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Relative import errors when running tests from platform-testing directory
```
‚ùå Service creation test failed: attempted relative import beyond top-level package
```

**Root Cause**: Service modules used relative imports (`from ..models.experiment import`) which failed when the test was run from outside the compute-platform directory.

**Solution**: Added fallback import handling in all service files:

#### Files Modified:
- `compute-platform/services/experiment_tracker.py`
- `compute-platform/services/model_registry.py` 
- `compute-platform/services/auth.py`
- `compute-platform/storage/experiments.py`

#### Fix Applied:
```python
try:
    from ..models.experiment import Experiment, ExperimentRun, HyperparameterTuningJob
    from ..models.job import Job
except ImportError:
    # Fallback for direct execution
    import sys
    from pathlib import Path
    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))
    from models.experiment import Experiment, ExperimentRun, HyperparameterTuningJob
    from models.job import Job
```

**Result**: All service modules can now be imported and instantiated successfully.

### 2. Async/Await Issues ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Service methods are async but test was calling them synchronously
```
‚ùå Basic workflow test failed: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'name'
```

**Root Cause**: The `ExperimentStore` and `ExperimentTracker` services have async methods, but the test was calling them without `await`.

**Solution**: Modified the basic workflow test to use async/await properly:

#### File Modified:
- `platform-testing/test_simple_api.py`

#### Fix Applied:
```python
def test_basic_workflow():
    """Test a basic workflow end-to-end"""
    try:
        import asyncio
        # ... imports ...
        
        async def run_workflow():
            # ... create objects ...
            
            # Store experiment (now with await)
            stored_experiment = await store.create_experiment(experiment)
            
            # Initialize tracking (now with await)
            tracked_experiment = await tracker.initialize_experiment(experiment)
            
            # Submit run as job (now with await)
            job = await tracker.submit_run(experiment, run)
            
            return True
        
        # Run the async workflow
        result = asyncio.run(run_workflow())
        return result
```

**Result**: Basic workflow test now properly handles async operations.

### 3. JSON Serialization Issues ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Enum objects couldn't be serialized to JSON
```
‚ùå Data serialization test failed: Object of type <enum 'JobStatus'> is not JSON serializable
```

**Root Cause**: The default JSON serializer doesn't know how to handle enum objects.

**Solution**: Enhanced the JSON serializer to handle enums and other objects:

#### File Modified:
- `platform-testing/test_simple_api.py`

#### Fix Applied:
```python
def json_serializer(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, datetime):
        return obj.isoformat()
    elif hasattr(obj, 'value'):  # Handle enums
        return obj.value
    elif hasattr(obj, '__dict__'):  # Handle other objects
        return obj.__dict__
    raise TypeError(f"Object of type {type(obj)} is not JSON serializable")
```

**Result**: All model objects can now be serialized to JSON successfully.
