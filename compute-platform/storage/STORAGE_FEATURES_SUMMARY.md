# Compute Platform Storage - Features Summary

## Overview

The storage layer provides pluggable data persistence for the compute platform with multiple backend implementations. The layer includes comprehensive job storage with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and file-based backends, plus experiment storage for ML workflows. The architecture supports both production database backends and development/testing implementations.
